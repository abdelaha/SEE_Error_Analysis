This program calculate a three metrics of each netlist of the given circuit.
1- The precentage of error that appear in this netlist over the whole error occurs in the circuit. 
2- The precentage of error that appear in the primary output over the errors appear in the netlist.
3- The number of netlist prior this netlist.
4- Number of errors that happen at this netlist and propagate successfully to the primary output.
5- Number of transitions that can occur at this netlist( I mean by transition: One to Zero or Zero to one without any failure in the circuit)




The program input is a verilog file that comes from synthesis tools, plase note that, it shouldn't contains any registers (purly combination circuit) and dosen't include any "reg".
Furthermore, this program is wirtten escpically for a certain digital libarary that I used in the synposis synthesis tool.


Some Specific rule you have to follow:
1- Ordering of gate inputs in Verilog and Digital Libary
 // Get the binary values of Netlists which are connected to the inputs of the current gate (They will be returned ordered as they written in Verilog)
                //Please, make sure that the Digital Library follow the same order.










Comments and Explanation:
1- propagated Errors to Outputs
  This is the propagted Errors to primary output which has been injected in the Target Netlist itself.

2- propagated Errors to Netlists
  This is the Propagated Errors to the Target Netlist from the Back Cone.
  
Note: the propagated Errors from BackCone can be progated to the primary output or not. Despite that the sources of erros in the metecs 1 do not make different, Metercs 1 still can not determine how many errors from back cone can propagate 
to the primary outputs thorough the target netlist. This is why we use InputVectorErrors struct to determine this issue.
